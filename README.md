# Quizzotron

This is my version of the solo project suggested at the end of the Scrimba React course. It is based off of a design shared on Figma. All code is my own.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Features

The quiz currently renders example data as 5 multiple choice questions. Answers can be selected and then checked. Checking answers will close the quiz so it cannot be interacted with again. Playing again will reset the state and allow the quiz to be run again.

Further improvements will be made to pull from the Open Trivia DB API to get new questions on each run.

## Install

### `npm install`

Run the install to download all the necessesary dependencies.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can also run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
